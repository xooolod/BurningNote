**Share your secret notes with BurningNote app!**
BurningNote allows you to create one-time notes. Once you have written your note, the app will generate a unique link for your note. You can share the link to anyone, but please pay attention: the note will be burned as soon as someone reads it!

- **Demo**: [Preview on Heroku](https://burning-note-220ef495fdb9.herokuapp.com/)


# ðŸ§ª | Geek stuff: Run your own instance 

1) Firstly, clone the repo from github:
`git clone https://github.com/xooolod/BurningNote`
`cd BurningNote`
2) Then, install dependencies:
`npm i`
3) Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out
4) Rename `src/server/database/database.example.sqlite` to `database.sqlite`
5) You're good to go! You can run **development** build using `npm run dev`, or build the production version with `npm run start-all`.
