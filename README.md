**Share your secret notes with BurningNote app!**
BurningNote allows you to create one-time notes. Once you have written your note, the app will generate a unique link for your note. You can share the link to anyone, but please pay attention: the note will be burned as soon as someone reads it!

**Demo**: *coming soon...*
